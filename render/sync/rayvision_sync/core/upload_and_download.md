### Upload

#### 1. Upload file cutting

> Some upload.json files may have up to hundreds of thousands of resources, at this time you may need to cut the upload file。


```

#### 7. Upload file type (transmit_type)

> The upload file is controlled by the parameter "transmit_type", and the supported transmission file formats are: "upload_list" and "upload_json".

- 1. upload_list

  > The content of the "upload_json_path" file specified by this upload mode (support txt and json files) can be a file absolute path or folder absolute path for each line. If it is a folder, all files in the folder will be uploaded.

  For Example:

  ![](https://blog-tao625.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/izone/blog/20201116160335.png)

- 2. upload_json

  > The content of the "upload_json_path" file (json file) specified by this upload mode must follow a fixed format, and only files can be uploaded.

  For Example:

  ```json
  {
    "asset": [
      {

#### 1. to enable automatic acquisition of transmission lines (default is off), set automatic_line = True, for example:

- Automatically obtain the transmission line when uploading:

  `RayvisionUpload(api, automatic_line=True)`

- Download the transmission line automatically:

  `RayvisionDownload(api, automatic_line=True)`

#### 2. Enable automatic acquisition of transmission lines and select a network provider

The network business name can be obtained through the interface `get_transfer_config`

- Upload automatically obtain the transmission line and customize the network provider.

  `RayvisionUpload(api, automatic_line=True, internet_provider="移动")`

- Automatically obtain the transmission line and customize the network provider when downloading.

  `RayvisionDownload(api, automatic_line=True, internet_provider="移动")`

### Select transmission mode: tcp or udp

network_mode:  Control network transmission mode parameters
     0: Automatic selection (default)
     1:  tcp mode to transmit
     2:  udp mode to transmit

```
# Take download as an example:
download.auto_download([49240085], network_mode=2)

### Customize upload service address and transport engine selection

> Upload service address generally does not need to be modified, if the line is not good also support custom modification.
