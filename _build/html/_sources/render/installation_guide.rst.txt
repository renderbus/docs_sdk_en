Installation Guide
====================

**Method One (recommended):**

.. note::
   Users who have limited access to the Python official address network
   can download and install from our custom server。

- Download from Python official pypi (recommended)

   ``pip install rayvision_maya``

   ``pip install rayvision_clarisse``

   ``pip install rayvision_houdini``

- Install from a custom PIP server

   Before using specific rendering modules, such as Houdini rendering,
   please refer to the following installation method to install the modules in turn
   `rayvision_log`, `rayvision_api` , `rayvision_utils` , `rayvision_sync`,

**Method Two:**

Download source code directly from GitHub:

``git clone https://github.com/foxrenderfarm/rayvision_log.git``

``git clone https://github.com/foxrenderfarm/rayvision_api.git``

``git clone https://github.com/foxrenderfarm/rayvision_utils.git``

``git clone https://github.com/foxrenderfarm/rayvision_sync.git``

*other modules are installed similarly to the secondary installation method*
